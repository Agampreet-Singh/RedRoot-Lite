![RedRoot Banner](RedRoot.webp)

> *“Sometimes you gotta run before you can walk.”*

**RedRoot** is a modular, CLI-based offensive security framework written entirely in **Python**.  
It brings together **15+ real-world red teaming tools** into one unified terminal environment.

No GUI. No noise. Just raw command-line power.

Built for **penetration testers, red teamers, CTF players, and cybersecurity learners**.

RedRoot is not a wrapper.

It is a **full offensive security framework** covering:

- Network reconnaissance & exploitation  
- Web application attacks  
- Active Directory attacks  
- Wireless & proximity attacks  
- Post-exploitation & persistence  
- Social engineering  
- AI-assisted operations  

All controlled from a single CLI ecosystem.

### 🧠 Final Thoughts 

RedRoot isn't just a toolkit — it's a part of me.

You can try to separate me from the framework,  
strip it down to scripts and modules,  
but at the end of the day...

> **I am RedRoot.**

I built it in the command line.  
I debugged it in the dead of night.  
Every scan, every payload, every exploit — it has my fingerprint on it.

So no, it's not just a suit of tools.  
**The tools and I — we’re one.**

🛠️ Built with grit. Run with purpose.  
💻 Hack like you mean it.

## 🔮 What's Next?

Mark XLVII is here... but this isn't the end.

> One day, there will be a final release — **Mark 85**.

And when **Mark 85** arrives,  
it won’t just be an update...  
it’ll be a **declaration** — the **King of Cybersecurity**.

But don't get me wrong...  
I'm not saying that the god of technology has taken human form for the first time.

I'm just saying... **RedRoot Mark 85** will be close.
