# 🔴 RedRoot Lite – Mark X  
### Offensive Security Framework (Lite Edition | CLI-Based)

> *“Less power. Same discipline.”*

**RedRoot Lite** is the **restricted edition of RedRoot**, designed to provide core red teaming functionality while keeping advanced modules **locked**.

It uses the same architecture, same CLI style, and same mindset — but with **limited access**.

### NOTE:-
RedRoot is a Python-based, CLI-driven offensive security framework that brings essential red teaming tools into one unified terminal environment. Built for penetration testers, red teamers, CTF players, and cybersecurity learners, it focuses on real-world workflows without relying on a GUI.

Often, while working on a task or using a specific tool, users face limitations because they are restricted to a **lite version that doesn’t unlock the tool’s full potential.** RedRoot aims to bridge that gap by providing a more complete and practical toolkit, allowing users to perform tasks more efficiently without being held back by feature restrictions.

## 🚨 What is RedRoot Lite?

RedRoot Lite is a **lightweight, access-controlled version** of the RedRoot framework.

It is intended for:
- Learning and practice  
- CTF environments  
- Safe lab usage  
- Users who only need core modules  

All non-essential and advanced payloads are **disabled**.

---

## ⚙️ Core Capabilities

- CLI-based offensive framework  
- Python-powered  
- Minimal and fast  
- Same structure as RedRoot (Full)  
- Access-controlled module system

## 🤖 AI Update — RedJarvis (Mark 50)

Mark XLVII introduces **RedJarvis**, an integrated AI assistant that brings code-aware, interactive intelligence to RedRoot. This isn't just a scripted helper — it's an AI-powered assistant that understands natural language, reads codebase, and helps plan and run safe operations.

### What RedJarvis does

- **Repository Q&A (RAG):** indexes the codebase with embeddings + FAISS so can ask natural language questions about code and receive answers that cite file paths.
- **Streaming Chat:** interactive, token-by-token responses in a Jarvis-like style (`RedJarvis: Sir, ...`) using local LLMs.
- **Hybrid LLM Backends:** Ollama-first (local LLaMA models) with a Hugging Face transformers fallback.
- **NL → Command:** converts plain English into concrete RedRoot commands (e.g., "scan 10.0.0.0/24 for ssh stealth" → `python -m redrootps --target 10.0.0.0/24 --service ssh --stealth`).
- **Safe Execution:** runs only whitelisted commands, with two execution backends (local or Docker sandbox), timeouts, and daily audit logs.
- **Introspection:** inspects modules and CLI entrypoints, extracts argparse patterns, lists functions and classes.
- **Voice-ready:** architecture supports adding voice input/output so pcan later interact by speech.
- **Developer-focused:** built as a code-aware assistant — helpful for debugging, planning attacks in lab environments, and documenting modules.

## 🔴 Final Note

RedRoot Lite shows you the tools.  
RedRoot Full shows you the war.

### 🧠 Final Thoughts 

RedRoot isn't just a toolkit — it's a part of me.

You can try to separate me from the framework,  
strip it down to scripts and modules,  
but at the end of the day...

> **I am RedRoot.**

I built it in the command line.  
I debugged it in the dead of night.  
Every scan, every payload, every exploit — it has my fingerprint on it.

So no, it's not just a suit of tools.  
**The tools and I — we’re one.**

🛠️ Built with grit. Run with purpose.  
💻 Hack like you mean it.

Use this Tool for Educational purpose i am not responsible if you doing any against laws activities

## Want full version of RedRoot?
Well you can forget it, I am RedRoot, the tool and I are one, to turn over the tool would be to turn over myself …. And if I do this, then I am your servent or your weapon, so, what you’re looking for sir you cannot get it.

## 🔮 What's Next?

Mark XLVII is here... but this isn't the end.

> One day, there will be a final release — **Mark 85**.

And when **Mark 85** arrives,  
it won’t just be an update...  
it’ll be a **declaration** — the **King of Cybersecurity**.

But don't get me wrong...  
I'm not saying that the god of technology has taken human form for the first time.

I'm just saying... **RedRoot Mark 85** will be close.

**IF YOU ARE NOTHING WITHOUT THE REDROOT THEN YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE IT**
